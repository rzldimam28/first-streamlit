    Hello, i start this *machine learning app* with a very common sentence to programmer, haha. \n
    This is my very first *machine learning app* to build, so i hope you all to enjoy what i have build recently.
    # Introduction
    As a car owner, there are several things that i have to focused on, such as the price, the model, or maybe the car fuel efficiency. \n
    In this *machine learning app*, i want to build a model which can help us to purchase a car based on its fuel efficiency. \n
    The model build by using a *Multiple Linear Regression* model. According to the name, the model needs multiple independent variables
    that can see in **Data Overview** menu. You can build a better model with the same data using another *machine learning model*,
    such as *Random Forest*, *Support Vector Regressor* and *Neural Network*.  \n
